Rasgulla or Rosogolla is an Indian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.

The dish originated in East India; the present-day states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace. In 2015, a committee formed by the government of Odisha asserted that the sweet had originated in Odisha, where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple. In 2016, the West Bengal government applied for a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the variant called "Banglar Rosogolla" (Bengali Rasgulla) or normal Rasgulla, clarifying that the Bengal and Odisha variants were different in "both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing."

In 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's GI status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they site the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.

In 2018, Odisha government applied for GI status for "Odisha Rasagola" (Odia Rasgulla was declared different from normal Rasgulla), which got approved by GI Registry of India and subsequently Odisha got its own Rasagola's GI status on 29 July 2019.

                        <p>
                            Jalebi, also known as zulbia, jilapi, mushabak and zalabia, is an Arab and Indian sweet snack popular all over South Asia, and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup.

This dessert can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating. Citric acid or lime juice is sometimes added to the syrup, as well as rose water. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (North India) along with optional other flavours such as kewra (scented water).

This dish is not to be confused with similar sweets and variants like imarti and chhena jalebi.

                            Gulab jamun (also spelled gulaab jamun) is a milk-solid-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent, and a type of mithai, popular in India, Nepal, Pakistan (where it is known as gulab jamun), the Maldives (where it is known as gulaabujaanu), and Bangladesh (where it is known as gulab jam), as well as Myanmar. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as Mauritius, Fiji, the Malay Peninsula, Great Britain, South Africa, and the Caribbean countries of Trinidad and Tobago, (where it is called rasgulla), Guyana, and Suriname. It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally from khoya, which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of khoya. It is often garnished with dried nuts such as almonds and cashews to enhance flavour.
